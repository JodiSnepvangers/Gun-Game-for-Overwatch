# Gun Game for Overwatch
This game mode will let players score points by taking down other players. Head shots give extra points and melee will steal points from the opponent. Points determine how far up the player is in the rankings, and what hero they get to play. If a player gets stuck on the same hero after enough deaths, they will receive Echo's Helper, which lets them change into Echo and copy another hero of another player temporarily.

## How to play: 
Simply download the text file from the project, and copy its entire content to your clipboard. Open Overwatch, start a custom lobby, and open the settings. You should find a orange button near the top right that lets you import the script into the lobby.
